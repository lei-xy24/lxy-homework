    "### Course Project Candidate #1: Advanced Implementation of AES S-box using Tower Field Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to deepen your understanding of abstract algebra with a specific focus on finite field representations and field extensions as they are applied in cryptography. By exploring the practical implementation of the [AES S-box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_S-box) using the Tower Field architecture, you will enhance your understanding of the algebraic structures of Galois Fields and their practical application in cryptography.\n",

    "**Background & Resources:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) employs an S-box in each round of encryption and decryption, which is critical for introducing non-linearity. This S-box is based on the Galois Field $\\mathrm{GF}(2^8)$. The efficient implementation of this S-box is paramount for both software and hardware cryptographic applications. The Tower Field architecture provides a method for implementing the S-box using operations in smaller fields, which can be more efficient in certain contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have briefly covered the concept of Tower Fields for Computing Inverses in the AES S-box in our lecture (Please refer to the lecture note Lec04_Algebra_FiniteFeild_Practice.ipynb).
